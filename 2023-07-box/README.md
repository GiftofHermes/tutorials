This code is an implementation of `std::box::Box`, modelled after the code provided in the Nomicon.

Unfortunately, it does not work on Windows. To add support for MS Windows, take a look at the 
[`libc_alloc`](https://github.com/daniel5151/libc_alloc/tree/master) crate to get an idea of what
needs to change.
